# Share your apps
The app we have chosen to shared is the one we developed in 
the lesson 2. 

The chosen method to share it was as gist in github. It can 
be run easily executing through the following command:

```R
shiny::runGist("1bfc00a1b66fa34a941193b80fb2a959")
```

The url of the gist is [https://gist.github.com/angeligareta/1bfc00a1b66fa34a941193b80fb2a959](https://gist.github.com/angeligareta/1bfc00a1b66fa34a941193b80fb2a959)
